# Machine Learning Preprocessing GUI

This is a Graphical User Interface (GUI) application built using Streamlit that provides various preprocessing functionalities. It aims to simplify common data preprocessing tasks for to prepare the data for machine learning models. The tool can be an excellent resource for students who are just starting to learn about data preprocessing in machine learning. Students can gain hands-on experience with common data preprocessing techniques for data in the form of a CSV file. The user-friendly interface of the tool makes it easy for beginners to interact with the data and apply various preprocessing techniques.

## Features

1. **Information About Dataset**: Displays general information about the dataset, such as the number of rows and columns, data types, and summary statistics.

2. **Check For Duplicates**: Checks the dataset for duplicate rows and provides options to remove or handle them.

3. **Changing Datatypes**: Allows users to change the data types of specific columns in the dataset.

4. **Handling Missing Values**: Provides options to handle missing values in the dataset, such as dropping rows or filling missing values with appropriate methods.

5. **Encoding Categorical Attributes**: Offers various encoding methods to convert categorical attributes into numerical representations.

6. **Scaling Numerical Attributes**: Provides scaling options to normalize or standardize numerical attributes in the dataset.

7. **Univariate Data Visualization**: Enables users to visualize and explore individual columns in the dataset using different types of plots.

8. **Bivariate Data Visualization**: Allows users to select two columns and visualize the relationship between them using scatter plots, heatmaps, and line plots.

9. **Outlier Detection**: Detects outliers in numerical columns and highlights them in the dataset.

10. **Correlation**: Calculates and displays the correlation matrix and correlation heatmap for all columns in the dataset.

## How to Use

1. Install the required dependencies.

2. Run the application by executing `streamlit run File_Upload.py` in your terminal.

3. Upload a CSV file containing your dataset using the file uploader in the application.

4. Navigate through the different modules using the sidebar menu to perform desired preprocessing tasks.

5. Make selections and interact with the application to visualize, manipulate, and preprocess your dataset.

6. Review the results and download the preprocessed dataset if needed.

## Note

Please ensure that your dataset is in CSV format and follows the expected structure (rows as observations and columns as attributes).
